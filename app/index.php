        <h3 class="item-heading">Front-End Development</h3>
        <p>I build out visual components of websites and applications as well as integrate them with a database or Content Management System (CMS). Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other modern or popular languages, I can create fast, interactive web applications.</p>
        <h3 class="item-heading">Back-End Development</h3>
        <p>While I consider myself more of a front-end developer, I do have experience creating back-end databases and writing RESTful APIâ€™s to perform CRUD operations on database records.</p>
        <h3 class="item-heading">Wordpress</h3>
        <p>Wordpress is a powerful, open source CMS which, according to their website, is used by about 35% of the web. I have experience developing custom Wordpress sites, including building visual themes from scratch.</p>
        <h3 class="item-heading">UI/UX Design</h3>
        <p>User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design involve planning and iterating a site's structure and layout, which is a necessary first step in building any web site or application. I have experience using prototyping tools such as Adobe XD for this process.</p>
